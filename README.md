# Installation

## Requirements

- [GNU bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)
- [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/)

**Note:**

1. Please use this command to check whether tmux is able to find fzf [#1](https://github.com/sainnhe/tmux-fzf/issues/1): `tmux run-shell -b 'command -v fzf'`
2. Currently this plugin is only compatible with GNU sed. Other sed variants such as Mac OS sed or FreeBSD sed are not supported. You need to ensure that this plugin is using GNU sed(see [#5](https://github.com/sainnhe/tmux-fzf/issues/5) for steps to install GNU sed on Mac OS).

If you don't want to make GNU sed the system default, but instead customize the executable path, then add this line to your `$HOME/.tmux.conf`

```tmux
TMUX_FZF_SED="/path/to/sed"
```

## Install via [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm/)

Add this line into your `$HOME/.tmux.conf`

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'sainnhe/tmux-fzf'
```

Reload configuration, then press `prefix` + `I`.

# Usage

To launch tmux-fzf, press `prefix` + `F` (Shift+F).

This plugin supports multiple selection for some actions, you can press `TAB` and `Shift-TAB` to mark multiple items.

Most actions don't need to be explained, but there are some actions that might need to be explained here.

## link & move window

You can use **link** action to link a window from another session to current session.

launch tmux-fzf -> `window` -> `link` -> select a window in another session

And you can use **kill** action to unlink or kill current window.

`kill` actually use `tmux unlink-window -k` instead of `tmux kill-window`. The main difference between `unlink-window -k` and `kill-window` is that `kill-window` will kill current window and all other windows linked to it, while `unlink-window -k` will only kill current window.

The logic of the `unlink -k` action is a bit like hard link in unix/linux. If the current window only exists in one session, then kill; if the current window exists in multiple sessions, then unlink.

Btw, if you want to bind a key to kill current window, I would recommend `unlink-window -k` instead of `kill`.

**move** action is similar to link, except the window at source window is moved to destination.

## break & join pane

**break** action will break source pane off from its containing window to make it the only pane in destination window.

launch tmux-fzf -> `pane` -> `break` -> select source pane

**join** action is like split-window, but instead of splitting destination pane and creating a new pane, it will split it and move source pane into the current window. This can be used to reverse break-pane.

launch tmux-fzf -> `pane` -> `join` -> select source pane(s)

## user menu

You can add a custom menu to quickly execute some commands.

This feature is not enabled by default. To enable it, add something like this into `$HOME/.tmux.conf`

```sh
TMUX_FZF_MENU=\
"foo\necho 'Hello!'\n"\
"bar\nls ~\n"\
"sh\nsh ~/test.sh\n"
```

When you launch tmux-fzf, an extra item named `menu` will appear. Selecting this item will produce [this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37491630/66251156-71836000-e73c-11e9-809d-e865651f8d7d.png).

There will be 3 items to select from: `foo`, `bar` and `sh`.

When you select `foo`, tmux will execute `echo 'Hello!'`.

When you select `bar`, tmux will execute `ls ~`.

When you select `sh`, tmux will execute `sh ~/test.sh`.

**Note:**

- `foo` and `echo 'hello'` are separated by `\n` in `TMUX_FZF_MENU`, and you need to add another `\n` after `echo 'hello'`.
- **DO NOT** add additional white spaces/tabs at the beginning of each line.
- Commands are executed using `tmux -c`, so please make sure `tmux -c "your command"` makes sense.

# Customization

## key binding

For example, to use `prefix` + `C-f` (Ctrl+F), add this line into your `$HOME/.tmux.conf`

```tmux
set -g @tmux-fzf-launch-key 'C-f'
```

## fzf behavior

This plugin will read fzf environment variables, so you can customize the behavior of fzf such as prompt and color by setting those variables.

For more information, check [official page of fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/#environment-variables).

In addition, this plugin supports options of `fzf-tmux` command which is [provided by fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fzf-tmux-script), you can customize them by adding something like this into `$HOME/.tmux.conf`

```tmux
TMUX_FZF_OPTIONS="-d 35%"
```

To list all available `fzf-tmux` options, execute `fzf-tmux --help` in your shell.

## format

For some reasons, you may want to customize format of panes, windows, sessions listed in fzf. There are three variables to complete this work:

`TMUX_FZF_PANE_FORMAT`   `TMUX_FZF_WINDOW_FORMAT`   `TMUX_FZF_SESSION_FORMAT`

For example, `tmux list-panes -a` doesn't show running program and window name by default. If you want to show running program and window name, add something like this into `$HOME/.tmux.conf`

```tmux
TMUX_FZF_PANE_FORMAT="[#{window_name}] #{pane_current_command}  [#{pane_width}x#{pane_height}] [history #{history_size}/#{history_limit}, #{history_bytes} bytes] #{?pane_active,[active],[inactive]}"
```

Similarly, `TMUX_FZF_WINDOW_FORMAT` and `TMUX_FZF_SESSION_FORMAT` can also be handled in this way.

For more information, check "FORMATS" section in tmux manual.
